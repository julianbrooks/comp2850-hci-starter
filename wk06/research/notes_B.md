## Participant B
**Date**: 2025-11-10 15:20  
**Context**: Second-year CS student. Mostly uses a mobile phone on the train and bus. Sometimes has motion sickness.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~9 minutes  

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "This morning on the bus I opened Google Tasks to check what I needed to do before a group meeting. I was standing and holding onto the rail, so I had to use my thumb only. The screen was shaking a bit, so tapping small buttons was hard."

**Observations**:
- Emphasises “thumb only” and “shaking”.
- Mentions almost dropping the phone once.

### Q2: Biggest frustration with task management
**Response**: "I get frustrated when the app doesn’t show me what’s actually important right now. It lists everything, and I just scroll and scroll. There’s no clear indication of what’s urgent versus nice-to-do."

**Observations**:
- Sighs when talking about “scroll and scroll”.
- Mentions feeling guilty about not doing everything.
- Says they sometimes close the app without deciding.

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `information_overload`, `decision_fatigue`

### Q4: Using apps when you can’t use a mouse (e.g. bumpy train)
**Response**: "On the train, precise taps are almost impossible. I would prefer big, chunky buttons or maybe swipe gestures. Also, I wish there was an option to undo quickly in case I accidentally mark a task as done."

**Observations**:
- Brings up undo multiple times.
- Seems worried about losing information by mistake.

### Q5: Using a task manager with eyes closed or in bright light
**Response**: "In bright sunlight I can hardly see anything on my phone. If the contrast is low or the text is small, I just give up. I don’t use a screen reader, but sometimes I wish the app could 'speak' my tasks to me."

**Observations**:
- Squints while describing bright light.
- Touches their eyes, mentions headaches.
- Indicates curiosity about audio features but not sure how to use them.

**Themes**: `contrast`, `text_size`, `glare`, `potential_audio_output`

### Q6: One feature that would reduce stress
**Response**: "I’d like a ‘travel mode’ where the interface is simplified for use on the bus or train. Bigger text, bigger buttons, maybe offline mode and a simple summary like ‘two tasks due today’."

**Observations**:
- Emphasises limited attention while commuting.
- Mentions unreliable mobile signal.

**Themes**: `context_aware_mode`, `simplified_ui`, `offline_support`
