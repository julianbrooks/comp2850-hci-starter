## Participant A
**Date**: 2025-11-10 14:05  
**Context**: Second-year CS student. Uses keyboard-only workflows most of the time. Often works late at night when tired.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~12 minutes  

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "Yesterday evening I used Todoist to plan my coursework. I had a big list of deadlines and I was trying to prioritise which assignment to start first. I mostly used the keyboard shortcuts to add tasks and move them between projects. This can helps me stay focused."

**Observations**:
- Speaks quite fast, seems used to task tools.
- Emphasises “keyboard shortcuts” multiple times.

### Q2: What frustrates you most about managing tasks?
**Response**: "I hate when the app loses my context. For example, if I filter to just ‘COMP2870’ tasks and then I accidentally refresh the page, the filter resets and I see everything again. Then I have to remember what I was focusing on and set the filter again."

**Observations**:
- Frowns and pauses when talking about losing filters.
- Mentions this has happened "many times".

### Q3: A time you lost track of an important task
**Response**: "Last semester I completely missed a portfolio task submission. The task was in my list, but it was buried under a lot of low-priority items. I didn’t notice it because there was no way to highlight ‘critical’ tasks visually or sort them by urgency in the view I was using."

**Observations**:
- Says “I felt really stupid” but also blames the interface.
- Emphasises lack of visual hierarchy.

### Q4: Using apps without a mouse (keyboard-only)
**Response**: "Most web apps are annoying with just the keyboard. Sometimes the focus just disappears. I press Tab and I’m not sure where I am. Also, ‘Delete’ buttons are often only reachable with the mouse, or they are tiny icons with no visible focus state."

**Observations**:
- Gives concrete examples from multiple websites.
- Mentions feeling "lost" when focus is not clear.

### Q6: One feature that would reduce stress
**Response**: "I’d love a mode where the app shows only today’s critical tasks in a very simple list, maybe with a single key to mark them done. No sidebars, no extra panels, just ‘here are 3 things you must do today’."

**Observations**:
- Emphasises “simple” and “just three things”.
- Links this to feeling less overwhelmed.

**Themes**: `cognitive_load`, `focus_mode`, `progress_visibility`
