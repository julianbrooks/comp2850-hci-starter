## Participant C
**Date**: 2025-11-11 10:05  
**Context**: Second-year CS student. Reports high anxiety about deadlines. Says they are "bad at remembering details". Uses both laptop and phone.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~5 minutes  

### Q2: What frustrates you most about managing tasks?
**Response**: "I always feel like I’m forgetting something. Even when I put tasks into the app, I’m not sure if I captured them correctly. There’s no clear confirmation or summary, so I keep re-checking the list over and over."

**Observations**:
- Fidgets with their hands while speaking.
- Mentions “checking again and again”.
- Seems to link this to general anxiety, not just the app.

### Q3: A time you lost track of an important task
**Response**: "I once missed a doctor’s appointment because I put it into the wrong date by mistake. The app didn’t warn me that the date was in the past, so it just sat there. I assumed everything was fine until I realised it was already over."

**Observations**:
- Blames both themselves and the app.
- Emphasises the lack of warnings.

### Q5: Using a task manager with eyes closed or in bright light
**Response**: "Sometimes when I’m tired, I shut my eyes and just listen to music. I wish I could quickly hear my tasks, like a short audio summary, instead of having to read a long list."

**Observations**:
- Talks about “tired eyes” and headaches.
- Seems very interested in audio or spoken feedback.
- Mentions using podcasts a lot.

### Q6: One feature that would reduce stress
**Response**: "A daily ‘reassurance’ screen would help. Something that says: ‘You have 3 tasks today. One is already done. The next one starts at 3pm.’ That way I don’t feel like there are a hundred unknown things hiding in the list."

**Observations**:
- Smiles when imagining the reassurance screen.
- Uses words like “calm” and “less scary”.
- Explicitly says this would reduce their anxiety.
